## Legal issues
Since it is mainly the presentation of the data obtained from a legal API, [albion-online-data](https://www.albion-online-data.com/), this can't be ilegal.

## Running
*Mac users may refer to this issue: [#5](https://github.com/felipelincoln/albion-blackmarket-tool/issues/5)*

**Download the [latest release](https://github.com/felipelincoln/albion-blackmarket-tool/releases/latest)**, unzip it and run the executable file.  
The city you pick will be from where you are going to buy the items straight from the sell orders. You can also choose what kind of items you want to trade.
A little while after you click the search button a list with the following layout will brings up to you:

``
[ITEM]  [CITY_SELL_PRICE]  [BLACKMARKET_BUY_PRICE]   [PROFIT_VALUE_WITH_6%_TAX]
``

**Importante note**: the use of this program won't give you up to date prices.

## Real-time prices
In order to get market prices updated you have to first download the [albiondata-client](https://github.com/BroderickHyman/albiondata-client/releases) and keep it running. Then visit the market, the items in the current market tab will be automaticaly updated to the API.
